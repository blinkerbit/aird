## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install aird

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/blinkerbit/aird.git
cd aird
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start with default settings
aird

# Custom port and root directory
aird --port 8080 --root /path/to/files

# With authentication token
aird --token your-secure-token

# Enable LDAP authentication
aird --ldap --ldap-server ldap://your-server.com
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.json` file for advanced configuration:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "root_dir": "/path/to/files",
  "access_token": "your-secure-token",
  "admin_token": "admin-secure-token",
  "ldap": {
    "enabled": true,
    "server": "ldap://your-server.com",
    "base_dn": "dc=example,dc=com"
  },
  "feature_flags": {
    "file_upload": true,
    "file_delete": true,
    "file_share": true,
    "super_search": true
  }
}
```

## üîå API Usage

Aird provides a comprehensive REST API for all operations:

### File Operations
```bash
# List files in a directory
GET /api/files/path/to/directory

# Upload a file
POST /upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Download a file
GET /files/path/to/file?download=1

# Edit a file
POST /edit/path/to/file
Content-Type: application/json
{"content": "new file content"}

# Delete a file
POST /delete
Content-Type: application/json
{"path": "path/to/file"}
```

### Search Operations
```bash
# Search for text patterns
GET /search?q=search+term&path=/directory

# WebSocket search (real-time)
WebSocket: /search/ws
```

### Share Management
```bash
# Create a share
POST /share/create
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "paths": ["/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2"],
  "share_type": "static",
  "expiry_date": "2024-12-31T23:59:59"
}

# List active shares
GET /share/list

# Update a share
POST /share/update
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "share_id": "share-id",
  "share_type": "dynamic",
  "allow_list": ["*.txt", "*.log"]
}
```

### WebSocket Streaming
```javascript
// Connect to file streaming
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/stream/path/to/logfile.log');

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log('New line:', data.line);
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building Custom Applications

Aird's API-first design makes it perfect for building custom applications:

### Example: Custom File Manager
```python
import requests

class AirdClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url, token):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    
    def list_files(self, path):
        response = requests.get(f'{self.base_url}/api/files/{path}', headers=self.headers)
        return response.json()
    
    def search_files(self, query, path='/'):
        response = requests.get(f'{self.base_url}/search', 
                              params={'q': query, 'path': path}, 
                              headers=self.headers)
        return response.json()
    
    def create_share(self, paths, share_type='static'):
        data = {'paths': paths, 'share_type': share_type}
        response = requests.post(f'{self.base_url}/share/create', 
                               json=data, headers=self.headers)
        return response.json()

# Usage
client = AirdClient('http://localhost:8080', 'your-token')
files = client.list_files('/documents')
results = client.search_files('error', '/logs')
```

### Example: Log Monitoring Dashboard
```javascript
// Real-time log monitoring
const logStream = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/stream/var/log/app.log');

logStream.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    addLogEntry(data.line, data.timestamp);
};

function addLogEntry(line, timestamp) {
    const logContainer = document.getElementById('logs');
    const entry = document.createElement('div');
    entry.className = 'log-entry';
    entry.innerHTML = `<span class="timestamp">${timestamp}</span> ${line}`;
    logContainer.insertBefore(entry, logContainer.firstChild);
}
```
